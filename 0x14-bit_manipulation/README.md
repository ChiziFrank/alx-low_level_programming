Binary 
Bit manipulation in C refers to the process of manipulating individual bits within variables, typically integers, using bitwise operators. These operators allow you to perform various operations on the binary representation of the data. Bit manipulation is often used for tasks such as setting, clearing, toggling, or checking specific bits within an integer or other data types.
